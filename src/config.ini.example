[TEMPERATURE_SENSORS] 
# This is assuming that you are using the typical DS18B20 Sensors.
# Enter the GPIO Number (not the physical pin number) here.
# Multiple sensors can be attached to one pin, the average value will then be calculated.
# *IMPORTANT*: In the /boot/config.txt file, you will need to enter the one-wire interface in an ascending order, i.e. like this:
# dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=20
# dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=21
# Do not define more w1 overlays than you will be using, otherwise this won't work.

muro = {"GPIO": 20, "name": "Muro"}
koji = {"GPIO": 21, "name": "Koji"}

[DEVICES]
# Here you can define your devices. 
# Multiple pins can be supplied as a list, if you need to combine two relays for one device.
# Follow this pattern: 
heater = {"pin": [22,24], "name": "Heater"}
muro_vent = {"pin": 18, "name": "Muro Ventilator"}
